## Branch
1.	Branch is a copy of your repository that will isolate your changes without touching the original one such as from the Master. A branch is similar to a file directory. It will represent a working area where you can edit, stage, and commit once you ready to make live. It’s a way so the programmer can work on one thing while not interfering with another programmer when coding. See image below to see what branching looks like.
2.	Pull request is when you want to submit all your revision to the main project branch.
3.	So lets utilize GIt Basic Commands : 
	1.	git branch  - list all branches
	2.	git branch <Name> - creates a new branch called Name
	3.	git branch -d <Name> - delete branch
	4.	git -b checkout branch_name – is a shortcut to create a new branch and commit to another line
