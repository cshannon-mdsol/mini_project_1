## Branch
1.	Branch is a copy of your repository that will isolate your changes without touching the original one such as from the Master. A branch is similar to a file directory. It will represent a working area where you can edit, stage, and commit once you ready to make live. It’s a way so the programmer can work on one thing while not interfering with another programmer when coding. See image below to see what branching looks like.
2.	Use [Pull request](https://github.com/cshannon-mdsol/mini_project_1/blob/master/Stefan/Merge.md) when you are done with your changes soo the other developers will now what chnages were made within that file. Its a way to prevent merge conflict.
3.	So lets utilize GIt Basic Commands : 
	1.	git branch  - list all branches
	2.	git branch <Name> - creates a new branch called Name
	3.	git branch -d <Name> - delete branch
	4.	git -b checkout branch_name – is a shortcut to create a new branch and commit to another line
